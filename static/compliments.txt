You Are The Most Perfect You There Is.
You Should Be Proud Of Yourself.
You’ve Got All The Right Moves!
You’re Even More Beautiful On The Inside Than You Are On The Outside.
Of all the people in the world, I'm glad I get to know you.
Your smile is so contagious!
My life is better because you're in it.
If there was a zombie apocalpyse, I'd choose you for my zombie murdering squad. You slay!
You're like a choc-chip cookie, but like... a human.
You're an absolute hottie ;)
It's never dreary when you're around, you're a little ray of sunshine!
If life were a packet of gummy snakes, you'd be a red one.
You're the special kind of wonderful that I never get tired of seeing.
You're like a sunset on a partially cloudy day. Absolutely resplendent.
I'd choose you over sleeping in.
Puppies have nothing on you, you cutie!
You have the clarity of a diamond, the rarity of red beryl and all the subtle beauty of alexandrite.
