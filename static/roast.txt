You’re my favorite person besides every other person I’ve ever met.
I envy people who have never met you.
Maybe if you eat all that makeup you will be beautiful on the inside.
You’re kinda like Rapunzel except instead of letting down your hair, you let down everyone in your life.
You’re impossible to underestimate.
You’re not the dumbest person on the planet, but you sure better hope he doesn’t die.
If you were an inanimate object, you’d be a participation trophy.
You look like your father would be disappointed in you if he stayed.
If laughter is the best medicine, your face must be curing the world.
You must have been born on a highway because that's where most accidents happen.
Some babies were dropped on their heads but you were clearly thrown at a wall.
There is no vaccine against stupidity.
You're the reason the gene pool needs a lifeguard.
